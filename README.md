## Experiments

1. **Simulator Elevator Interface using switches and LEDs**

2. **Seven Segment Display Interface**
   - Write a C program to display messages “FIRE” & “HELP” on 4-digit seven segment display alternately with a suitable delay.

3. **Stepper Motor Interface**
   - Write an Embedded C program to rotate stepper motor in clockwise direction for “M” steps, anti-clockwise direction for “N” steps.

4. **DAC Interface**
   - Write an Embedded C program to generate sine, full rectified, triangular, sawtooth and square waveforms using DAC module.

5. **Matrix Keyboard Interface**
   - Write an Embedded C program to interface 4x4 matrix keyboard using lookup table and display the key pressed on the terminal.

6. **DC Motor Interface**
   - Write an Embedded C program to generate PWM wave to control speed of DC motor. Control the duty cycle by analog input.
